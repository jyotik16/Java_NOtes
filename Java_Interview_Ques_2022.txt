16. what is functional interface. does it have static and default methods.


1. program -  write program  - if input is GOD , it should generate the different word with combination different character - GOD ,GDO,ODG,OGD,DOG,DGO
2. program - Given unsorted array . search the element in array using Binary search.
3. program - call GC() every 5 min.

second round :
